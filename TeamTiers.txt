To accommodate a team from each of the four tiers, your roster size will shift from five to four teams. This creates a highly balanced "ladder" strategy where your success depends on finding a "basement diamond" (Tier 4) just as much as picking the right powerhouse (Tier 1).
Updated Tl;Dr.
This is a Ladder-Strategy league for 6 players. Every quarter, you manage a 4-team roster consisting of exactly one team from each performance tier (Elite, Strong, Average, and Basement). You "burn" your top choices as you go, forcing you to time your powerhouse picks perfectly while hunting for value in the lower tiers to win the season.
Official League Rules (The "Ladder Burn" Format)
1. Structure & Scoring
Participants: Exactly 6 players.
Scoring: Combined winning percentage of your 4 assigned MLB teams per quarter.
Season Winner: Highest cumulative win percentage across all four quarters.
Tie-Breaker: Cumulative average Runs Scored per game across all rostered teams.
2. Roster Composition (4 Teams Total)
Each player manages exactly one team from each tier:
1 Team from Tier 1 (Elite)
1 Team from Tier 2 (Strong)
1 Team from Tier 3 (Average)
1 Team from Tier 4 (Basement)
3. Selection & Randomization
Manual Choice (Tier 1 & Tier 2): You choose one team from each of these top tiers.
The Burn Rule: You cannot manually choose the same team twice in a season (regardless of what tier they are in when you pick them).
Duplicates: Multiple players can choose the same T1 or T2 team.
Random Assignment (Tier 3 & Tier 4): The app/commissioner randomly assigns you one team from Tier 3 and one from Tier 4.
The Refresh Rule: If you were randomly assigned a team in Q1, you can still manually choose them in a later quarter.
Personal Unique: You will never be randomly assigned a team you already chose manually for that same quarter.
2026 Season Tier Examples
Based on early 2026 projections and World Series odds, here is how the tiers might look for your first quarter: 
Tier 	Description	2026 Team Examples
Tier 1	The Elites	Dodgers, Yankees, Phillies, Braves, Mariners, Blue Jays
Tier 2	The Contenders	Mets, Red Sox, Brewers, Padres, Cubs, Tigers, Astros, Rangers
Tier 3	The Middle	Guardians, Orioles, Reds, Giants, Diamondbacks, Rays, Twins, Cardinals
Tier 4	The Basement	Athletics, Marlins, Angels, Pirates, Nationals, White Sox, Rockies, Royals
Why this is fun: By Quarter 4, you will have "burned" 4 Elite teams and 4 Strong teams. If you used the Dodgers and Yankees early, you might be stuck choosing the Mariners or a surging Tier 2 team for your final T1 slot, making the late-season tiers highly impactful.

This is a Ladder-Strategy league for 6 players with a $120 total prize pool ($20 buy-in). Each quarter, you manage a 4-team roster (one from each performance tier). You must strategically "burn" your manual picks, as once you select a team, you cannot pick them again. The goal is to maximize win percentages to claim quarterly cash and the overall season title.
